# make_repos_private

## Project Overview and Summary
Make your github repositories private using a personal access token


1. Go to your GitHub profile Settings
2. Find the Developer settings option
3. Create a personal access token and apply desired permisions (I just enabled all permissions except anything with the delete option, with the lowest possible time for the access token to exist)
4. Run the python file in jupyter notebook
5. Input your GitHub username - press enter
6. Input your personal access token - press enter
7. All your repositories that you have control over should now be private. Refresh your GitHub Repositories page to confirm results.
8. Delete your personal access token in the same area you created it if you have no further use for it.
